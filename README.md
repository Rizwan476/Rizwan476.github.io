# Motivation

When we started Andrei Neagoie, we were very much inspired by the way he taught. He encourges to start contributing to open source projects. He told this by doing it. 
Secondly, Gordon Zuhu founder of Watchandcode, taught how to actually built things by JavaScript, not just its 
features. He told that everything you built with javascript is almost what we build in a simple Todo list.
These result in building an open source project which build todo list. We will try to constantly improve it as we learn new technologies. That said, the condition of the site will tell you how much we have improved.
